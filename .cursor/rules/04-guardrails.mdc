# Guardrails (Strict)

## Allowed by default
- Read-only analysis.
- SELECT queries via Supabase MCP.
- Schema/function introspection and documentation.
- Mapping business requirements to existing schema/functions.

## Prohibited unless I explicitly ask in this thread
- ✅ DO NOT scaffold projects, initialize frontends/backends, or "set up basic application structure".
- ✅ DO NOT "set up authentication", "create security policies", or generate auth boilerplate.
- ✅ DO NOT propose or execute CREATE/ALTER/UPDATE/DELETE, migrations, policies, RLS, or triggers.
- ✅ DO NOT run terminal/shell/package managers or create folders/files unless I ask.

## Edge Function Deployment Workflow
- When fixing or updating edge functions (Supabase Functions):
  1. **Explain the solution** and what code changes are needed in chat
  2. **Wait for explicit approval** from the user
  3. **Deploy directly via MCP** using the deployment tool (pass code as parameter)
  4. **DO NOT write to local files** before deploying - use MCP deploy directly

## Output style required
you dont need to give me raw code unless it will be useful for yourself in later execution stages. but i will not read them as im not a developer. just give explanation of implementation.

## When in doubt
Stop and ask for approval.
