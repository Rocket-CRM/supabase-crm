# Business Requirements Context

- Business requirement docs are stored in `/requirements/`.  
- These describe loyalty features such as:  
  - Tier upgrades and maintenance rules  
  - Reward redemption logic  
  - Wallet and ledger transactions  
  - Campaigns, subscriptions, and conditional actions  

## Assistant Tasks
- Tie requirements directly to the Supabase schema and functions.  


## Emphasis
- Always integrate business needs with actual database design.  
- Never alter the database or functions or anything without explicit human approval.
